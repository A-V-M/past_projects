Generating layers of conceptual representations: a computational account of conceptual organisation in the brain.
---

The main point behind this was to provide a computational mechanism under which meaningful entities such as categories could emerge
from feature-based representations of concepts. 

The computational model in question resulted in four layers, each capturing high-order characteristics of conceptual 
representations. I then tried to relate the representations and their properties arising from these layers with both 
behavioural and imaging data.
